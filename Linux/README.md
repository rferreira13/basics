Pipe commands:

> [Pipe commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/) are a way to manipulate stdin, stdout and stderr.

Examples:

List with ls command, detailed with the flag -l, and searches word file on the output: 

> ls -l | grep file

Redirects output. Instead of the console, the output will go to sida.txt file:

> ls -l > saida.txt

Appends the output. The output will be added on the bottom of the file sida.txt file:

> ls >> saida.txt

The command 2> will redirect the stderr when an error occurs:

> mkdir non_existing_dir/non_existing_dir 2> erro.txt

[Mounting points](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=systems-mounting)

Mounting is used for:

- External Hard Drives or USB Drives
- Network File Systems (NFS)
- New Hard Drives or Partitions
- Encrypted Drives
- Filesystem Repair or Recovery
- Virtual File Systems

List all devices and special files in the /dev directory:

> ls -a /dev 

Figure out what is the name of your partition.

Hard drives and partitions are typically represented by device files in this directory, with names like `sdX` or `hdX`, where `X` is a letter that represents the order of the device. 

Here's how you can identify your hard disk or partition:

- For traditional spinning hard drives and SATA SSDs, device names usually start with `sd`. For example, `sda` would be the first hard drive, `sdb` the second, and so on. Partitions on these devices are represented by numbers following the device name, like `sda1`, `sda2`, etc.
- For NVMe SSDs, the device names start with `nvme`. For example, `nvme0n1` would be the first NVMe drive, and its partitions would be represented as `nvme0n1p1`, `nvme0n1p2`, etc.

To avoid seeing all loops you may use the command below, and check the name of your hard drive:

> lsblk -o NAME,TYPE | grep -v loop

mount requires a super user. Use the command:

> sudo mkdir /mnt/external_hd

> sudo mount /dev/[partition_name] /mnt/external_hd

> sudo umount /mnt/external_hd

List all mounted devices with mounting pints

> df -h

SSH:

> [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/command#:~:text=A%20little%20history-,SSH%20Command%20in%20Linux,SSH%20from%20a%20remote%20location.) is a secure shell protocol. The ssh command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network.


There is 2 ways to use ssh:

- User/password
- Key pair


User/password:

- Go to cloud provider
- Create an instance
- Choose password authentication
- On your local, apply command:
> ssh root@[IP_address]
- Confirm password
- Terminate connection:
> exit

Key pair:

- Must create public key, and private key
- Public key is the 'locker', private key is the 'locker key'
- Public key is placed on the server, private key on the local
- Create using [type](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/host-key) [rsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) using 2048 bits
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
- Give a password to the key
- list your keys:
> ls ~/.ssh/
- id_rsa will be the private key, id_rsa.pub will be the public key
- Copy the content of your public key:
> xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
- Create an instance
- Add your public key to the server
- On your local, apply command:
> ssh root@[IP_address]
- Doesn't require password, will use id_rsa
